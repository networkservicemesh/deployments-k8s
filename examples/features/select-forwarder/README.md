# Select forwarder by capability example

The example demonstrates how can be declareded forwarder selection in [network service](https://networkservicemesh.io/docs/concepts/architecture/#network-service).

Important points: 
 - [client](./client.yaml) requests `select-forwarder` service.
 - [forwarder](./forwarder.yaml) registers itself with label `my_forwarder_capability: true`
 - [network service](./service.yaml) declaretes network service `select-forwarder` that contains match for label `my_forwarder_capability: true`
 - [network service-endpoint](./nse-patch.yaml) registers as an [endpoint](https://networkservicemesh.io/docs/concepts/architecture/#network-service-endpoint) for service `select-forwarder`

See at example resources in [kustomization.yaml](./kustomization.yaml)

## Requires

Make sure that you have completed steps from [basic](../../basic) setup.

## Run

Apply example resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/examples/features/select-forwarder?ref=v1.14.5-rc.3
```

Wait for applications ready:
```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --timeout=1m pod -l app=alpine -n ns-select-forwarder
```

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --timeout=1m pod -l app=nse-kernel -n ns-select-forwarder
```

Ping from NSC to NSE:
```bash
kubectl exec pods/alpine -n ns-select-forwarder -- ping -c 4 169.254.0.0
```

Ping from NSE to NSC:
```bash
kubectl exec deployments/nse-kernel -n ns-select-forwarder -- ping -c 4 169.254.0.1
```

Verify that NSMgr selected the correct forwarder:
```bash
kubectl logs pods/alpine -c cmd-nsc -n ns-select-forwarder | grep "my-forwarder-vpp"
```

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete ns ns-select-forwarder
```
